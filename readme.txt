This is a small program which automatically shuts down your PC.
It should run on Windows Vista and Windows 7.
Before shutting down, it checks whether the user is idle (at least 30 minutes), and whether a backup (with Macrium Reflect) is running.
The program can be extended with more rules by implementing the IShutdownRule interface and adding it to the ShutdownSafetyProtocol.
